Goal of this program is to inform tourists traveling California who want to check quick weather data about the different cities.

Makes hundreds of API calls to store wind speeds of every city in California in a SQLite database, then queries through database upon clicking the button in the React-native front end, and displays the result.

Currently a work in progress. More features will be added to this program.
